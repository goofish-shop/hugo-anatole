## Research Interests
<hr />

My research is concentrated on computer vision and deep learning, with a particular emphasis on generative
models and their broader impacts. I am currently working on the denoising diffusion model for 3D generation
and image generation. Besides, I explore the wider implications of generative models in non-content synthesis
research domains, such as synthetic data’s impact on vision tasks and generative probabilistic models for
open-world problems. I believe understanding these potentials can drive innovations in computer vision and
beyond.

Ph.D Student, Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Aug. 2022 - Present  <br/>
Advisor: Xiaojuan Qi

Sun Yat-sen University Guangzhou, China <br/>
B.Sc in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics Aug. 2016 - June 2021 <br/>

* GPA: 94/100; Ranking: 2/130
* After studying in the School of Physics from Aug. 2016 to June 2017, my interests led me to Mathematics.
I ranked first in the transfer exam, enabling my switch to the School of Mathematics, where I completed
my degree from Aug. 2017 to June 2021.
