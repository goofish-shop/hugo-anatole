I do computer vision and deep learning, with a particular emphasis on Generative AI and its broader impacts. I am currently a third-year PhD student in the University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Xiaojuan Qi. I received my Bachelor Degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University. I was/am fortunate to intern at VAST and Adobe Research.
